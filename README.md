# PredMed
PredMed is a web app that can predict 4 diseases currently - Diabetes, Heart disease, Parkinson's and Breast Cancer based on the user given info. The prediction is done by Classification ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest Classifiers and XGBoost Classifier. The datasets used for training the model and the jupyter notebooks where all the data processing and model training was done are also shared in this repository.  
The web app has a home page for a brief explaination and to predict a particular disease, one can select that disease from the sidebar present at the left side.  
The web app was made using the Streamlit library of python.
